What is BASH Shell?

BASH (Bourne Again Shell) is the default command-line interpreter for most of the Linux Distros these days. It is an updated version of the earlier Bourne shell. If you are a Linux system administrator or a power user, you must have excellent knowledge of BASH shell commands to perform day to day tasks.

What is BASH Scripting?

Mostly we use shell commands one by one in the terminal for our everyday tasks. Still, sometimes you have to perform complex tasks or repetitive tasks, which involves a series of commands being executed in a proper sequence. A shell can also take commands as input from a file, so to make our job easy, we can write these commands in a file and can execute them in the shell to avoid manual work. These files are called shell scripts.

Let’s understand the BASH Shell Scripting

    Create a file using a text editor with .sh extension
    Start the script with #!/bin/bash
    Write some code/commands
    Save the script file as filename.sh

Advantages

The bash script has many advantages:

    It automates repetitive work that saves a lot of effort and time.
    You can create your power tool or utility.
    Bash scripts are portable; you may use a script on other Linux systems without any modification.
    It has the same set of the syntax that we use in standard terminal, so do not involves additional learning.
    You can quickly write a bash script with little help.
    It can provide interactive debugging while running tasks that help in case of error or issue.

Disadvantages

The bash script can have disadvantages:

    Prone to errors, a single mistake can change the program’s flow and can be harmful.
    Slow execution speed.
    Have very minimal data structures, unlike other programming languages.
    Not well suited for large and complex tasks.
