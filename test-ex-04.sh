#Using Comments
: '
Comments are a programmer’s remarks about the purpose of the code or logic. It’s a widespread practice to add comments so that in the future, anyone can understand code by just reading comments. Comments are part of code but ignored by the compiler. In the bash script, any line that starts with # is considered a comment. For example:


Here’ # this is a comment’ is a comment, and when we run this script compiler will ignore the line.

Comments can be:

    Single Line Comment
    Multiple Line Comment

We use ‘#’ for single line comment and: ‘content’ for multiple line comments. Check the below command for both single and numerous comments in a bash script.

sum=$((2+8))
# result will be 
echo "sum is "$sum""
