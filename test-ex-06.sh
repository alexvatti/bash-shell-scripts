# Description: Start Bash Shell Script

#Using Command Arguments

#We can also read user input from command arguments, just like any other programming language. 
#We can then use these arguments in our scripts as $1, $2, and so on, depending on the number of arguments we have provided. 
#Create a file’ arguments.sh’ and copy the below lines in it.

echo "Total arguments : "$#""
echo "Username: "$1""
echo "Age: "$2""
echo "Full Name: "$3""
